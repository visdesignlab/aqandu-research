### Synopsis

A low-cost, efficient pollution monitoring embedded system is currently under design by the electrical engineering team. The goal is a device that does not significantly sacrifice accuracy of PM concentration measurement for a small, low-cost, low-power footprint. Each station is fully self-contained, and is capable of relaying data about its environment to a cloud storage at an arbitrarily rapid rate. The stations will be distributed across Salt Lake City through a citizen science engagement effort.
The computer science team will stream the measurements into a statistical modeling system to estimate PM levels across Salt Lake City. This system will combine sensor measurements with land-use information to produce accurate, real-time estimates and fine-grained resolutions. The estimates will be communicated to the public through a web-based visualization interface. This interface will include advanced functionality to support individualized sense-making of PM exposures.

The combined system will be a reliable and scalable cyber-physical framework for estimating air quality at a fine-grain in both space and time, coupled with fundamental breakthroughs in low-cost sensing, reliable modeling of environmental factors, and communication of air quality to the public. The proposed system should demonstrate the following:
1. flexible, general, integrated approach to acquiring PM measurements with varying degrees of density/accuracy/reliability,
2. incorporating land use, topographic data, and weather data, with sensor measurements
3. estimates of air quality with relatively high resolution in space and time,
4. validated with quantifiable estimates of expected error,
5. reasonable expectations of privacy for citizen- based monitoring stations, and
6. a responsive visualization-based API that can communicate estimates of PM levels and error estimates for any point in the Salt Lake Valley over a defined historical period.
